Go to the "Edit symbol" context menu option and copy/paste the symbol you want from this site: [http://unicode-table.com/en/sets/animals/](http://unicode-table.com/en/sets/animals/)

... Or this site: [http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Tips-Guides/Unicode-characters-to-copy-and-paste/td-p/1978667](http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Tips-Guides/Unicode-characters-to-copy-and-paste/td-p/1978667) (Or use Google to find more characters)

Even though your text editor won't display it, Rainmeter will still show the symbol on the screen!

You can change the font size, color, number of bands, and number of displayed "levels" through the "Edit variables" context menu option

You may have to manually adjust the "CharacterWidth" option if your chosen symbol is trimmed at the skin boundaries

The Update frequency is 80 by default (Fastest is 16), but at the expense of performance you can change it through the "Edit skin" context menu option

You may have to refresh the skin at least *three* times when you change the number of bands

This is because every character is a String meter -- Because emoji are not fixed-width and messes up padding

The meter sections are dynamically generated as separate files to be included in the skin
